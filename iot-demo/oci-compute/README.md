# oci-compute — run the ZPR IoT demo on OCI compute

Provisions the three-instance OCI topology that runs the whole ZPR demo (node,
visa service, adapters, mosquitto + OCI bridge, and both devices) instead of the
9-terminal single-laptop setup. See [TOPOLOGY.md](TOPOLOGY.md) for the diagram,
port matrix, and the decisions behind this layout.

This file is the deployment and verification reference. For *how to present the demo* —
the attribute flip that grants and revokes access live — see
[General Idea of How To Run The Demo](../README.md#general-idea-of-how-to-run-the-demo)
in the top-level README.

> **Status: working end-to-end on OCI.** Verified 2026-07-06 — clean `tofu apply` →
> all services up on first boot → `post-init.sh` → device_a telemetry reaches the OCI
> digital twin; device_b blocked by ZPR policy. See TOPOLOGY.md "Deployment gotchas"
> for the issues found and fixed along the way.

## Layout

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `provider.tf` | OCI provider (profile DEFAULT) |
| `variables.tf` / `terraform.tfvars` | inputs; real compartment/region in tfvars |
| `network.tf` | VCN, subnet, IGW, route table, **security list (layer-1 firewall)** |
| `compute.tf` | the three instances (device-a, device-b, zpr-core) |
| `objectstorage.tf` | bucket for staging `ph`/`vs`/policy/cert bundles |
| `cloud-init/*.tftpl` | per-role first-boot config (**layer-2 firewall**, deps, start) |
| `outputs.tf` | public/private IPs + ready-to-paste SSH commands |
| `lib.sh` | shared helpers (SSH, address discovery, `start_device`) — sourced, not run |
| `post-init.sh` | one-time zpr-core setup after `tofu apply` (egress addr + return-path routing) |
| `restart-core.sh` | sequentially restart the zpr-core ZPR chain (after a binary swap / clean bounce) |
| `vs-admin.sh` | run `vs-admin` locally against the visa service admin API over an SSH tunnel |
| `attribute.sh` | set/delete actor attributes in the live `attrfile.json` on zpr-core + flush the vs |
| `start-device-a.sh` | start the ZPR-allowed device (telemetry → OCI) |
| `start-device-b.sh` | start the ZPR-blocked device (denied by the visa service) |

## Apply

Prerequisite: the `../oci-iot` stack must be applied (this root reads its outputs
for the mosquitto→OCI bridge credentials via `terraform_remote_state`).

```bash
tofu init
tofu plan
tofu apply
./post-init.sh          # one-time zpr-core setup (egress addr + return-path routing)
./start-device-a.sh     # start the allowed device
./start-device-b.sh     # start the blocked device
```

## Run it yourself — step by step

### 0. Prerequisites

- **OpenTofu/Terraform** and the **OCI CLI** (`oci`) on `$PATH`, with `~/.oci/config`
  profile `DEFAULT` pointing at the ZPR-IoT-Demo tenancy.
- **The `../oci-iot` stack applied** (`tofu -chdir=../oci-iot apply`) — this root reads
  its outputs for the OCI bridge credentials.
- **SSH keypair** at `~/.ssh/zpr-demo` (public half is injected into the instances).
  Generate once if missing: `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/zpr-demo -N ""`.
- **Source paths configured**: `cp sources.env.example sources.env` and point
  `ZPR_CORE_SRC` / `ZPR_VS_SRC` at your checkouts. Every script here derives its paths
  from those two. See the top-level [README](../README.md#environment-variables).
- **OL9-compatible binaries**: `ph`/`vs`/`vsapikey` must be built against Oracle Linux 9's
  glibc, not your laptop's. Run `./build-in-ol9.sh` (needs Docker); it writes them to
  `$ZPR_BUILD_DIR/target/release/` and generates `binaries.auto.tfvars`, which tofu loads
  automatically — `variables.tf` has no defaults for those paths, by design.
- **A current policy**: `setup/iot-demo.bin2` is committed but built by hand. If the `vs`
  you're deploying has moved a version, recompile it — see the top-level
  [README](../README.md#compile-the-policy-manual).

### 1. Deploy

```bash
tofu init
tofu apply                    # ~2 min: network, bucket+artifacts, 3 instances
```

Wait for zpr-core's cloud-init to finish (installs packages, pulls artifacts, starts
the ZPR stack — ~2-3 min after the instance appears):

```bash
CORE=$(tofu output -raw zpr_core_public_ip)
ssh -i ~/.ssh/zpr-demo opc@$CORE 'sudo cloud-init status --wait'
```

`cloud-init status` reports one of: `not run`, `running`, `done`, `error`, or the edge
cases `disabled` / `degraded done` (degraded = finished with recoverable errors). Use
**`--wait`**, not a `grep -q done` polling loop: `--wait` blocks until cloud-init reaches
a terminal state (done *or* error), prints dots while it works, then exits `0` on success
and non-zero on error/degraded. A `grep done` loop, by contrast, spins **forever** if
cloud-init errors (e.g. a failed package install) — you'd think it's still booting when
it has actually failed. `--wait` can't hang on failure and gives a clear signal either way.

Then set up zpr-core (discovers the dynamic egress address, installs the egress
return-path routing) and start each device:

```bash
CORE=$(tofu output -raw zpr_core_public_ip)
./post-init.sh          # one-time zpr-core setup — run before the device scripts
```

The two device scripts are independent — you can start/stop either on its own (e.g.
start device-a, confirm OCI is receiving, then start device-b and watch it get denied).
Rerun `post-init.sh` first after any stop/start of zpr-core (the egress address changes).

Handy: `tofu output ssh_commands` prints ready-to-paste SSH commands for all three hosts.

### 2. Verify the ZPR stack on zpr-core is healthy

```bash
CORE=$(tofu output -raw zpr_core_public_ip)
ssh -i ~/.ssh/zpr-demo opc@$CORE \
  'for u in valkey zpr-tuns zpr-node zpr-vs-adapter zpr-vs zpr-egress mosquitto; do
     printf "%-16s %s\n" $u $(systemctl is-active $u.service); done'
```

All seven should read `active`. (If `zpr-vs`/adapters are `activating`, the auth
authority didn't register — see TOPOLOGY.md gotcha #3.)

### 3. Verify device_a telemetry reaches the broker (the ZPR-allowed path)

This proves device_a → device-a adapter → node → egress → mosquitto works:

```bash
CORE=$(tofu output -raw zpr_core_public_ip)
ssh -i ~/.ssh/zpr-demo opc@$CORE \
  "mosquitto_sub -h localhost -p 1883 -t 'devices/#' -v"
```

Expect a `devices/device-a/telemetry {…}` line every ~5s. With the attributes as shipped
(`setup/attrfile.json`), **only device-a** appears here. If device-b shows up too, a
previous run left it approved on the instance — `./attribute.sh push` restores the
baseline.

### 4. Verify the data reaches the OCI IoT Platform

This proves the mosquitto→OCI bridge works (the final hop):

```bash
INST=$(tofu -chdir=../oci-iot output -raw device_a_instance_ocid)
watch -n 1 "oci iot digital-twin-instance get-content --digital-twin-instance-id $INST --query data"
```

```bash
CORE=$(tofu output -raw zpr_core_public_ip)
./start-device-a.sh     # allowed device — telemetry should flow to OCI
```

```bash
./start-device-b.sh     # blocked device — denied by the visa service
```

The returned `content` shows `temperature_c` / `humidity_pct` matching what device_a
is publishing (20-25 °C / 40-60 %). Re-run it and the values track the live stream.
Or watch it in the Console: **IoT → ZPR-Demo-Domain → Digital Twin Instances →
zpr-iot-demo-device-a → Content**.

### 5. Verify device_a is granted a visa *by the visa service*

Symmetric to the block below: device_a's flow is authorized by the visa service, which
logs the grant as a `created visa` line. A grant is **cached** (long-lived), so it's
logged once and device_a then runs quietly. So to *watch* a grant happen you force a
fresh device_a flow (restarting its adapter gives it a new ZPR address, which triggers
a new visa request):

```bash
CORE=$(tofu output -raw zpr_core_public_ip)
DA=$(tofu output -raw device_a_public_ip)

# terminal 1 — follow the visa service on zpr-core:
ssh -i ~/.ssh/zpr-demo opc@$CORE 'sudo journalctl -u zpr-vs -f'

# terminal 2 — force a fresh device_a flow:
ssh -i ~/.ssh/zpr-demo opc@$DA 'sudo systemctl restart zpr-device-a'   # new address
./start-device-a.sh                                                    # re-wire + publish
```

In terminal 1 you'll see the grant appear:

```
vs::visa_mgr: created visa 1004
```

That is the visa service authorizing device_a's flow under the policy's single `allow`
rule — `allow VerifiedIoTDevices to access OracleIoT`, which device-a matches because
`attrfile.json` gives it `OCIApproved:true`. Contrast with device_b, which never gets one.

### 6. Verify device_b is genuinely blocked *by the visa service*

Getting no device-b data isn't enough — we want to *see* the visa service deny it.
On zpr-core, follow the visa service log while device_b keeps trying:

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/zpr-demo opc@$CORE 'sudo journalctl -u zpr-vs -f'
```

You'll see a denial once a second for about five seconds:

```
vreq: visa request from fd5a:5052:90de::1 denied (no match): no matching policy
```

Those come from the node (`fd5a:5052:90de::1`) on device_b's behalf. `iot-demo.zpl`
names no devices at all — its one rule allows `VerifiedIoTDevices`, defined as *a device
with `OCIApproved:true`*. device-b's entry in `setup/attrfile.json` is `"nope"`, so it
matches no rule and is denied, where device_a (`"true"`) got a `created visa` in step 5.
Flip that attribute and device-b is admitted with no policy change — that's the demo
narrative in the [top-level README](../README.md#general-idea-of-how-to-run-the-demo).

The burst lasts five seconds because that's device_b's socket timeout: the publisher
retries once a second, then exits. It has `Restart=no` (compute.tf — the blocked device
fails once and stays down instead of spinning), so nothing retries afterwards.

**Prove the denials are device_b, not noise** — relaunch its publisher and watch a fresh
burst appear in step with it:

```bash
DB=$(tofu output -raw device_b_public_ip)
ssh -i ~/.ssh/zpr-demo opc@$DB 'sudo systemctl start zpr-device'   # new 5s burst of denials
```

For the device's own view of being blocked, its publisher times out on connect:

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/zpr-demo opc@$DB 'sudo journalctl -u zpr-device -n 20'
# -> socket.timeout: timed out  (the SYN is dropped at the node; no visa)
```

## Visa service admin (vs-admin)

The visa service exposes an admin HTTPS API on `https://[fd5a:5052::1]:8182` (bound on
tun8). It needs an API key, and the endpoint is only reachable on zpr-core itself.

**The API key needs no setup.** cloud-init ships `vsapikey` to zpr-core, creates the key
before the services start (into `/vs_keys.toml`, which the vs reads) and saves the full
string to `/opt/zpr/vs/admin-api.key`. `vs-admin.sh` re-fetches that into
`oci-compute/.vs-admin.key` (gitignored) on every run, so it can't go stale after a
destroy/reapply.

To mint another key by hand — `vsapikey create <read|readwrite> <owner> [keyfile]
[--init]`; the vs reloads its key file on **SIGUSR2** (no restart, so no AA-race risk):

```bash
CORE=$(tofu output -raw zpr_core_public_ip)
ssh -i ~/.ssh/zpr-demo opc@$CORE 'sudo /usr/local/bin/vsapikey create readwrite me /vs_keys.toml --desc me
  sudo systemctl kill -s SIGUSR2 zpr-vs'
# point vs-admin.sh at it with VS_KEYFILE=... (it leaves non-default key files alone)
```

**Use `vs-admin` locally over an SSH tunnel** — `./vs-admin.sh <args>` opens a
forward to the admin endpoint, runs your laptop's `vs-admin`, and closes the tunnel.
Because the forwarded connection originates on zpr-core it counts as same-host (no extra
ZPR policy needed):

```bash
./vs-admin.sh actors        # list actors (node, egress, vs, devices)
./vs-admin.sh services      # list services (incl. OracleIoT)
./vs-admin.sh policies --curr
./vs-admin.sh stats
```

Build a current `vs-admin` on your laptop first (`cd "$ZPR_VS_SRC" && cargo build -p
vs-admin`) so its subcommands match the running vs. This is a plain debug build, not an
OL9 one — `vs-admin` never leaves your machine. `vs-admin.sh` finds it at
`$ZPR_VS_SRC/target/debug/vs-admin`; override with `VSADMIN` / `VS_CA` / `VS_KEYFILE`.

### Editing the attribute file (attrfile.json) live

`setup/attrfile.json` supplies per-actor attributes (e.g. `OCIApproved`) that policy can
test. It's uploaded to the bucket and pulled to `/opt/zpr/vs/attrfile.json` at boot;
`vs-conf.toml` points the vs at that directory via `file_ts_dir` (the vs's CWD is `/`, so
the path must be explicit).

Use `./attribute.sh` — it edits the file on zpr-core and flushes the vs in one step. No
restart, and active visas are revalidated against the new data:

```bash
./attribute.sh set device-a.zpr.org OCIApproved false   # watch its traffic get cut off
./attribute.sh set device-a.zpr.org OCIApproved true    # ...and come back
./attribute.sh del device-a.zpr.org OCIApproved         # drop the attr entirely
./attribute.sh show device-a.zpr.org                    # or `show` for the whole file
./attribute.sh push                                     # re-push setup/attrfile.json
```

Setting a value that's already there (or deleting an attr that isn't) prints `-> no
change` and skips the flush. An unknown actor is an error listing the ones that exist —
attributes only apply to actors already in the file. `./attribute.sh selftest` checks the
edit logic offline (no SSH, no OCI).

Manual fallback, if you want to hand-edit or batch several changes:

```bash
CORE=$(tofu output -raw zpr_core_public_ip)
ssh -i ~/.ssh/zpr-demo opc@$CORE 'sudo vi /opt/zpr/vs/attrfile.json'
./vs-admin.sh services -i attrfile --flush
```

`attrfile` is the service id the vs registers for the attribute file; `--flush` requires
`-i`.

Edits on the instance are **lost on the next `tofu apply`** that recreates zpr-core —
copy anything you want to keep back into `setup/attrfile.json` (and `attribute.sh push`
sends that file back the other way, after an apply or a bad edit).

## Unverified assumptions (check on first apply / boot)

- EPEL package + service names on Oracle Linux 9: `oracle-epel-release-el9`,
  `valkey`/`valkey.service`, `mosquitto`/`mosquitto.service`. Adjust if they don't start.
- `instance_image_id` (variables.tf) is a pinned OL9 image OCID — confirm it's current.
- Substrate is **UDP 5000**: zpr-core opens it in firewalld (it listens); device
  instances are outbound-only so need no inbound rule.
- The device password is baked into zpr-core's `user_data` (base64, not encrypted) —
  visible in instance metadata. Acceptable for a demo; note it for a shared deployment.

## Cost hygiene

x86 compute bills only while running. Between demos:
- **Stop** the instances (OCI pause) for short gaps — compute billing halts, boot
  volumes persist (~$few/month), ~1 min reboot. Rerun `post-init.sh` after (ZPR
  re-grants dynamic addresses on restart).
- **`tofu destroy`** when away longer — $0, but a full re-apply to rebuild.
